# Requirements Document

## Introduction

An image optimization system that processes a collection of project images for web deployment. The system converts images to WebP format, optimizes file sizes while maintaining visual quality, and preserves original filenames for easy identification and website integration.

## Glossary

- **Image_Optimizer**: The system that processes and converts images
- **Source_Image**: Original image files in various formats (JPG, PNG, DNG, JPEG)
- **WebP_Image**: Optimized output image in WebP format
- **Quality_Threshold**: Minimum acceptable visual quality level for optimized images
- **File_Size_Reduction**: Percentage decrease in file size after optimization

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to convert my project images to WebP format, so that my website loads faster with smaller file sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL convert all supported image formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG, DNG) to WebP format
2. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL maintain the original filename structure with WebP extension
3. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL preserve visual quality above Quality_Threshold during conversion
4. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL process all images in the current directory
5. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL create optimized images in a designated output directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to reduce image file sizes without losing visual quality, so that my website performs better while maintaining professional appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL analyze each Source_Image for optimal compression settings
2. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL achieve File_Size_Reduction while maintaining visual fidelity
3. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL apply different optimization strategies based on image content type
4. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL validate output quality meets Quality_Threshold requirements
5. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL report compression statistics for each processed image

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to preserve original filenames during optimization, so that I can easily integrate optimized images into my existing website structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL maintain exact filename structure from Source_Image
2. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL replace only the file extension with .webp
3. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL handle special characters and spaces in filenames correctly
4. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL preserve filename case sensitivity
5. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL create a mapping report of original to optimized filenames

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to process multiple images efficiently, so that I can optimize my entire project gallery quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL process all images in the source directory automatically
2. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL handle different image formats in a single batch operation
3. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL provide progress feedback during batch processing
4. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL continue processing remaining images if individual conversions fail
5. THE Image_Optimizer SHALL generate a summary report of all processed images
